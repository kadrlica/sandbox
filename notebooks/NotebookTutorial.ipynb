    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a tutorial for using ipython notebooks. This is not comprehensive documentation (that can be found [here](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/)), but rather just some things that I have found to be useful in my day to day work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, ipython notebooks are great for bridging the gap between sending someone a plot and sending someone the code to make a plot. Notebooks provide a way to simultaneously share and explain code, as well as offering a semi-permanent medium for presenting and reproducing an analysis."
